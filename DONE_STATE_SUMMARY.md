## Quick Reference: What Does "DONE" Mean?

| Sub-Hub | DONE When... | SQL Check | Current Coverage |
|---------|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Company Target** | `execution_status='ready'` AND `email_method IS NOT NULL` | Email pattern discovered | 91.4% (37,878/41,425) |
| **Blog Content** | `outreach_id IS NOT NULL` | Record exists | 98.2% (41,425/42,192) |
| **DOL Filings** | `ein IS NOT NULL` AND `filing_present=TRUE` | Filing verified | 27.7% (11,685/42,192) |
| **BIT Scores** | `score IS NOT NULL` AND `signal_count > 0` | Score calculated | 31.3% (13,226/42,192) |
| **People (Slots)** | `is_filled=TRUE` (3+ slots per company) | Slots assigned | 21.6% (27,303/126,576 slots) |
| **People (Contacts)** | `email_verified=TRUE` | Email verified | 0.8% (324/42,192 companies) |

## Key Findings

1. **Company Target is the anchor** - 91.4% completion, controls downstream execution
2. **Blog Content is auto-populated** - 98.2% coverage, minimal manual intervention
3. **DOL Filings are partially complete** - Only 27.7% have verified filings (40% attempted)
4. **People Intelligence is severely underutilized** - Only 324 people for 42K companies
5. **BIT Scores require multi-hub signals** - 31.3% coverage due to People/DOL dependencies
6. **No status column in outreach.outreach** - Status tracking is at sub-hub level (e.g., `company_target.execution_status`)

---

## Critical Schema Corrections

### outreach.company_target
- ✓ Field name is `confidence_score` (NOT `email_method_confidence`)
- ✓ Status field is `execution_status` with values: `ready`, `pending`, `failed`

### outreach.outreach
- ✗ **No `status` column** - This table is spine only (outreach_id, sovereign_id, timestamps)
- ✓ Status tracking happens in `outreach.company_target.execution_status`

## Three-Tier DONE Framework

### Tier 1: Marketing-Ready (80% of spine)
```sql
-- Company has email pattern + high confidence
WHERE execution_status = 'ready'
  AND email_method IS NOT NULL
  AND confidence_score >= 0.8
```
**Estimate**: ~34,000 companies

---

### Tier 2: Enrichment Complete (20-24% of spine)
```sql
-- All sub-hubs DONE (Company Target + Blog + DOL + BIT)
WHERE Company Target = ready
  AND Blog EXISTS
  AND DOL filing_present = TRUE
  AND BIT score IS NOT NULL
```
**Estimate**: ~8,000-10,000 companies

---

### Tier 3: Campaign-Ready (<1% of spine)
```sql
-- People verified + ready for campaigns
WHERE Slots filled >= 3
  AND People email_verified = TRUE
```
**Estimate**: Very low (people coverage is minimal)

## Files Generated

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **DONE_STATE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md** | Detailed analysis with all query results |
| **DONE_STATE_QUERIES.sql** | Production-ready SQL queries |
| **docs/DONE_STATE_DEFINITIONS.md** | Formal DONE criteria definitions |
| **verify_done_state.py** | Python script used to execute queries |

## Production Recommendations

1. **Focus on Company Target completion** - It's at 91.4%, push to 95%+
2. **Prioritize People Intelligence** - Only 0.8% coverage is severely limiting campaign readiness
3. **DOL enrichment is optional** - 27.7% is acceptable for signal-based scoring
4. **Blog Content is sufficient** - 98.2% is excellent
5. **BIT Scores will improve automatically** - As People/DOL coverage increases

---

## Next Steps

1. Review `outreach.company_target_errors` (4,404 errors) to understand failure patterns
2. Investigate why only 324 people records exist for 42K companies
3. Consider implementing People Intelligence backfill for high-value companies
4. Monitor CL-Outreach alignment weekly (currently perfect at 42,192 = 42,192)
