# Completion Rule

A node is ✅ at 40k only when its TODO.md shows all items checked.

## System Overview

This is the master tracking for the complete Outreach & Doctrine system. Each node operates at multiple altitudes (30k→20k→10k→5k) with specific responsibilities:

### Node 1: Company+DB (PLE+Enrich)
Foundation data layer handling company ingestion, people-lead-entity management, and data enrichment pipeline.

### Node 2: Messaging Prep (Cold+BIT+Doc)
Message preparation engine managing cold outreach sequences, BIT classification, and doctrine compliance.

### Node 3: Campaign Exec (APIs Layer)
Campaign execution platform handling API integrations, scheduling, rate limiting, and delivery across channels.

### Node 4: Vault+Compliance (Gatekeeper)
Governance layer managing compliance rules, audit trails, gatekeeper controls, and data vault operations.

## Altitude Progression

Each node follows the same altitude progression:

- **30k**: Scaffolding & Contracts (declarations, stubs, no runtime)
- **20k**: Core Logic & Validation (design docs, business rules)
- **10k**: Integration & Mechanics (scraping, reconciliation, flows)
- **5k**: Runtime & Operations (full implementation, monitoring)

## Progress Tracking

Individual node progress is tracked in each node's TODO.md file. This 40k star document provides the high-level rollup status.

**Manual Process**: Check off nodes here only when their TODO.md shows 100% completion at all altitudes.
