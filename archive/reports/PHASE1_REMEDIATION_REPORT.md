## Actions Completed

### Step 1: Archive DOL Structural Errors
| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| DOL errors archived (PARKED → ARCHIVED) | 29,740 |

All DOL structural errors (NO_MATCH, NO_STATE) are now marked ARCHIVED.

### Step 2: Archive CT Parked Errors
| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| CT parked errors archived | 26 |

All retry-exhausted CT errors are now marked ARCHIVED.

### Step 3: Delete Stale Validation Log
| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| Stale entries deleted | 2 |

Pre-2026 validation failures removed.

### Step 4: MX Re-verification
| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| Domains checked | 3,536 |
| MX valid | 204 |
| MX invalid | 3,332 |

**Key Finding**: 94% of CT error domains have no valid MX records. These are likely:
- Domains that no longer exist
- Domains with broken DNS
- Typos or incorrect domain data from CL

### Step 5: Web Scraping
| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| Domains scraped | 204 |
| Patterns found | 42 |
| Emails discovered | 154 |

Scraped all 204 domains with valid MX. Found email patterns on 42 domains.

### Step 6-7: CT Updates
| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| CT records updated | 0 |

Note: SSL connection dropped before updates could be applied. Patterns will be re-discovered in Phase 2.

## Key Insights

### Why 94% of domains have no MX

The CT-M-NO-MX errors are NOT simply "missing MX records" — they're fundamentally broken:
- Domain doesn't exist (NXDOMAIN)
- DNS is misconfigured
- Original CL domain data was incorrect

**Implication**: These records likely cannot be fixed by any enrichment tool. They need CL domain re-verification or manual review.

### Phase 2 Recommendation

For the remaining 4,378 CT RETRY errors:
1. **204 domains with valid MX** — Run Apollo enrichment (~$10)
2. **3,332 domains without MX** — Flag for CL review or PARK

For the 1,053 People RETRY errors:
1. Run Apollo people search (~$50)

## Remaining Work (Phase 2)

| Error Type | Count | Recommended Action | Est. Cost |
|------------|------:|--------------------|-----------:|
| CT RETRY (valid MX) | ~204 | Apollo enrichment | ~$10 |
| CT RETRY (no MX) | ~3,332 | Park or CL review | $0 |
| People RETRY | 1,053 | Apollo search | ~$50 |
| Blog UPSTREAM | 2 | Auto-resolve | $0 |

**Estimated Phase 2 cost**: ~$60
