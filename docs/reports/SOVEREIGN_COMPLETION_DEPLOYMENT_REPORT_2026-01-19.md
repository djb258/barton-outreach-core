## Migrations

| Migration | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| hub_registry | **OK** | 6 hubs seeded (4 required, 2 optional) |
| company_hub_status | **OK** | Table created with TEXT type for company_unique_id |
| manual_overrides | **OK** | Kill switch table with override_type_enum |
| vw_sovereign_completion | **OK** | Returns 33,922 rows |
| vw_marketing_eligibility | **OK** | Tier computation working |
| vw_marketing_eligibility_with_overrides | **OK** | Override enforcement working |

---

## Backfill Counts Per Hub

| Hub | Status | Count |
|-----|--------|-------|
| company-target | PASS | 33,921 |
| dol-filings | IN_PROGRESS | 33,921 |
| people-intelligence | IN_PROGRESS | 33,921 |
| talent-flow | IN_PROGRESS | 33,921 |
| **TOTAL** | | **135,684** |

**Backfill Source:** `initial_migration`

---

## Marketing Tier Distribution (Post-Backfill)

| Tier | Name | Count | Percentage |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| -1 | INELIGIBLE | 1 | 0.00% |
| 0 | Cold | 33,921 | 100.00% |
| 1 | Persona | 0 | 0.00% |
| 2 | Trigger | 0 | 0.00% |
| 3 | Aggressive | 0 | 0.00% |

**Note:** All companies start at Tier 0 (Cold) because only company-target hub is PASS. Other hubs need processing to advance tiers.

---

## Sanity Checks

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Row count = companies x required hubs | **PASS** (135,684 = 33,921 x 4) |
| No NULL hub statuses | **PASS** |
| No COMPLETE without all PASS | **PASS** |
| Override view returns data | **PASS** (33,922 rows) |

---

## Anomalies Found

1. **1 company has Tier -1 (INELIGIBLE)** - This is expected for records without proper company_unique_id
2. **All DOL/People/TalentFlow at IN_PROGRESS** - Expected; these hubs need data processing to reach PASS
3. **0 companies at Tier 3** - Expected; requires all 4 required hubs PASS + BIT >= 50

## Handoff Statement

> **Sovereign Completion infrastructure is now deploy-complete and ready for re-validation.**

The Data Validation Agent should now re-run validation to confirm:
- vw_sovereign_completion returns correct data
- vw_marketing_eligibility_with_overrides respects kill switches
- Sample companies have correct tier assignments
