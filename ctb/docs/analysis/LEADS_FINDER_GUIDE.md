  appName: 'apify',
  input: {
    company_industry: ['information technology & services'],

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with `max_leads: 10-50` first to verify results
2. **Use Multiple Filters**: Combine industry + job title + seniority for precision
3. **Monitor Costs**: Each lead costs $0.0015-$0.002
4. **Check Success Rate**: Current 68% success rate - expect some failed runs
5. **Timeout**: 50-minute timeout means large requests (1000+ leads) should complete
6. **Free Plan Limit**: Limited to 100 leads per run on free tier
