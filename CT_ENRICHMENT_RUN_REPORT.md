## Data Gap Analysis

### Why Enrichment Is Limited

The NOT_READY records are blocked primarily by **missing domains** in company_master:

| Issue | Count | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Missing domain | ~3,500+ | Requires domain discovery API (Firecrawl, GooglePlaces) |
| Missing pattern | ~11 | MillionVerifier can resolve |
| No CT record | ~767 | Pipeline must create record |

### API Keys Not Configured

The following enrichment APIs are NOT configured in Doppler:

| Tool | API Key | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| Firecrawl | NOT SET | Cannot scrape JS-rendered pages for domain |
| GooglePlaces | NOT SET | Cannot resolve business to domain |
| Hunter.io | NOT SET | Cannot use Hunter for pattern discovery |

### Recommendation

To unlock the 4,314 NOT_READY records:

1. **Configure Firecrawl API key** in Doppler
2. **Configure GooglePlaces API key** in Doppler
3. Re-run this enrichment script
4. Expected cost: ~$50-100 for domain discovery + ~$150 for pattern discovery
