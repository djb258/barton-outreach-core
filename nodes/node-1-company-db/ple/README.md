# PLE (People, Lead, Entity) Sub-Node

**Altitude**: 30k (Declaration Only)
**Status**: Stub/Placeholder

## Purpose

The PLE sub-node manages the People-Lead-Entity relationship system:

- **People**: Individual contacts with roles at companies
- **Leads**: Qualified prospects in sales pipeline  
- **Entity**: Companies, organizations, and business units

## Events (Placeholder)

### Input Events
- `company.created` - New company added to system
- `slot.initialized` - Role slot created (CEO/CFO/HR)
- `contact.discovered` - Person identified at company

### Output Events  
- `person.linked` - Person connected to company slot
- `lead.qualified` - Contact meets lead criteria
- `entity.enriched` - Additional company data acquired

## Future Design (20k+)

At higher altitudes, this sub-node will handle:
- Person-to-slot assignment logic
- Lead scoring and qualification
- Entity relationship mapping
- Contact enrichment workflows

## Current State

⚠️ **30k Scaffolding Only**: This directory contains declarations and stub files only. No implementation exists at 30k altitude.
