## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables for Production

```env
NODE_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=warn

# Security
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000

# Webhook Security  
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secure_webhook_secret

# Monitoring
OUTCOME_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS=30000
```

### Process Management

Use PM2 for production deployment:

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start services
cd services/instantly-integration
pm2 start src/index.js --name instantly-integration

cd services/heyreach-integration  
pm2 start src/index.js --name heyreach-integration

# Monitor
pm2 list
pm2 logs
```

## üéØ Integration with 3-Slot System

Both integrations support the **3-slot contact system**:

- **CEO Slot**: Executive-level messaging
- **CFO Slot**: Finance-focused messaging  
- **HR Slot**: Benefits and HR messaging

When adding contacts, specify the `slotType` field:

```json
{
  "contacts": [
    {
      "email": "ceo@company.com",
      "firstName": "John", 
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "companyName": "Acme Corp",
      "title": "CEO",
      "slotType": "CEO",
      "contactId": "uuid-here",
      "companyId": "company-uuid"
    }
  ]
}
```

This enables slot-specific analytics and personalized messaging strategies.
